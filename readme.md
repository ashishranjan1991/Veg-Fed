# Bihar State Vegetable Cooperative ERP - Deployment Guide

This document outlines the professional deployment process for the **Bihar State Vegetable Processing & Marketing Co-operative Federation Ltd. (VEGFED)** ERP system on AWS Cloud.

## 🏗 System Architecture
*   **Frontend**: React (TypeScript) SPAs hosted on **AWS Amplify** or **Amazon S3 + CloudFront**.
*   **Database**: **Amazon RDS (MySQL 8.0)** for centralized data storage.
*   **AI Engine**: **Google Gemini API** for generating real-time agricultural advisories.
*   **Security**: **AWS IAM** for access control and **Secrets Manager** for API keys.

## 🚀 1. Local Development
Before deploying, ensure the app runs correctly in your local environment.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

---

## ☁️ 2. AWS Frontend Deployment (AWS Amplify)
AWS Amplify is the recommended method for deploying this React application as it handles CI/CD and SSL automatically.

1.  **Connect Repository**: Connect your GitHub/Bitbucket repository to the AWS Amplify Console.
2.  **Build Settings**: Amplify will auto-detect the build settings. Ensure the `baseDirectory` is set to `dist` or `build`.
3.  **Environment Variables**:
    *   Go to **App Settings > Environment Variables**.
    *   Add `API_KEY`: [Your Google Gemini API Key].
4.  **Deploy**: Trigger a build. Amplify will provision a CloudFront distribution and provide an `https://...` URL.

## 🗄️ 3. Database Setup (Amazon RDS)
To enable the backend connectivity shown in the ERP modules:

1.  **Create RDS Instance**:
    *   **Engine**: MySQL 8.0.x
    *   **Tier**: Free Tier or Burstable (t3.micro/small).
    *   **Public Access**: Set to "No" (use a Bastion host or VPC Peering for security).
2.  **Security Groups**: Allow inbound traffic on port `3306` from the application's VPC.
3.  **Initialize Schema**:
    *   Connect to the instance using a client (MySQL Workbench/DBeaver).
    *   Execute the `veg.sql` file found in the project root to create tables and seed initial data.

---

## 🔐 4. Configuration & Security
*   **SSL/TLS**: AWS Amplify provides managed certificates. If using S3+CloudFront, use **AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)**.
*   **Gemini API Protection**: Do not hardcode the `process.env.API_KEY`. Ensure it is only accessible via the build-time environment in Amplify.
*   **CORS Configuration**: If you build a custom Node.js API later, ensure CORS allows requests only from your Amplify domain.

---

## 📊 5. Post-Deployment Maintenance
1.  **Price Sync**: Admins must use the **Master Data Module** to push "Centralized Daily Prices" to the MySQL database every morning (08:00 AM IST).
2.  **Backups**: Enable **Automated Backups** in RDS with a 7-day retention period.
3.  **Monitoring**: Use **Amazon CloudWatch** to monitor frontend latency and database CPU utilization.

## 📞 Support & Credits
*   **Organization**: Bihar State Vegetable Processing & Marketing Co-operative Federation Ltd. (VEGFED)
*   **Department**: Cooperative Department, Government of Bihar.
*   **Developer Notes**: This ERP implements a 3-tier framework (Farmer -> PVCS -> District Union).
